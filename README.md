# Python_SQL_Sales_Project

Title : Python SQL Sales Data Analytics Project

Overview:
This project analyzes a company's sales data to answer key business questions and uncover insights. Using Python and SQL in a Jupyter Notebook environment, the project leverages data analysis libraries to handle and visualize the data. The data is stored in a MySQL database, and various queries are performed to extract meaningful information.

Technologies Used:

Python: For scripting and data analysis.
SQL (MySQL): For database management and querying.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
Matplotlib: For plotting graphs.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and documentation.



Key Features:

Data Import and Cleaning: Imported CSV files into MySQL, cleaned data using Pandas.
Basic Queries: Analyzed unique cities, order counts, sales per category, installment payments, and customer distribution.
Intermediate Queries: Assessed monthly orders, average products per order by city, revenue percentage by category, product price correlation, and seller revenue ranking.
Advanced Queries: Computed moving averages, cumulative sales, year-over-year growth, customer retention, and top spenders per year.
Visualization: Created bar charts and pie charts to present the results.



What I Learned
SQL Querying: Writing complex SQL queries.
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing data with Pandas.
Data Visualization: Creating visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Integration: Combining SQL and Python for data analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: Using it for interactive analysis and documentation.



Scope for Improvement
Performance Optimization: Speed up SQL queries.
Advanced Visualization: Use interactive tools like Plotly.
Machine Learning: Add predictive analytics.
Automation: Automate data import and cleaning.



Advantages
Comprehensive Analysis: From basic statistics to advanced metrics.
Scalability: Suitable for large datasets.
Integration: Leverages both SQL and Python strengths.
Reproducibility: Well-documented in Jupyter Notebook.



Disadvantages
Complex Setup: Requires MySQL and multiple Python libraries.
Performance: Slower with very large datasets.
Learning Curve: Requires knowledge of both SQL and Python.
